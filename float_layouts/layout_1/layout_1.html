   <h3>ELECTRIC SIX LYRICS</h3>
   <p><b>"Night Vision"</b></p>

   <p>You can come and see me<br>
     But I don't glow in the dark<br>
     So you're gonna have to learn to use a little night vision<br>
     <br>
     Then you must decide<br>
     Who resides in your heart<br>
     And baby I know that's not an easy decision<br>
     <br>
     Oh, I went bananas<br>
     When I spoke with you on the telephone<br>
     I feel you lie telling me you're all alone<br>
     <br>
     Cause there's demons in you<br>
     And there's demons in me<br>
     Is it too dark for you to see?<br>
     <br>
     Now you don't want to hear it<br>
     But it's time that you realize<br>
     That your eyes aren't being properly utilised<br>
     <br>
     You can turn off the television<br>
     You can turn off the lights<br>
     But you can't hide from the darkness of your lies, woah<br>
     <br>
     There is a lunatic who lives in the center of your mind<br>
     He's eating you and leaving this insanity behind<br>
     <br>
     And he's taking over you<br>
     And he's taking over me<br>
     Is it too dark for you to see?<br>
     <br>
     You can come and see me in the dark<br>
     (If you use night vision)<br>
     Don't need no fire and no spark<br>
     (If you use night vision)<br>
     Give this love a kick start<br>
     (If you use night vision)<br>
     <br>
     (Night vision)<br>
     (Night vision)<br>
     (Night vision)<br>
     (Night vision)<br>
     <br>
     In the land of the blind<br>
     The night vision users are laughing at the king<br>
     But you'd be surprised what you can see<br>
     When you shine your evil light on me<br>
     <br>
     There we were<br>
     Just the two of us<br>
     Watching light fade into darkness<br>
     <br>
     I was dying<br>
     But then you saved me<br>
     Brought me back, just to say to me, woah<br>
     <br>
     There are asteroids in the sky brighter than you ever will<br>
     There are humanoids that love money so much that they would kill<br>
     <br>
     And it's taking over you<br>
     And it's taking over me<br>
     Is it too dark for you to see?<br>
     <br>
     You can come and see me in the dark<br>
     (If you use night vision)<br>
     Don't need no fire and no spark<br>
     (If you use night vision)<br>
     Give this love a kick start<br>
     (If you use night vision)<br>
     <br>
     (Night vision)<br>
     Come and see me in the dark<br>
     (Night vision)<br>
     Come and see me in the dark<br>
     (Night vision)<br>
     Come and see me in the dark<br>
     (Night vision)<br>
     <br>
     (Night vision)<br>
     (Night vision)<br>
     (Night vision)<br>
     (Night vision)<br>
     <br>
     (Night vision)<br>
     (Night vision)<br>
     (Night vision)<br>
     (Night vision)</p>
