  <h3>   "Night Vision" </h3>
    <p>You can come and see me<br>
    But I don't glow in the dark<br>
    So you're gonna have to learn to use a little night vision<br>
    <br>
    Then you must decide<br>
    Who resides in your heart<br>
    And baby I know that's not an easy decision<br>
    <br>
    Oh, I went bananas<br>
    When I spoke with you on the telephone<br>
    I feel you lie telling me you're all alone<br>
    <br>
    Cause there's demons in you<br>
    And there's demons in me<br>
    Is it too dark for you to see?<br>
    <br>
    Now you don't want to hear it<br>
    But it's time that you realize<br>
    That your eyes aren't being properly utilised<br>
    <br>
    You can turn off the television<br>
    You can turn off the lights<br>
    But you can't hide from the darkness of your lies, woah<br>
    <br>
    There is a lunatic who lives in the center of your mind<br>
    He's eating you and leaving this insanity behind<br>
    <br>
    And he's taking over you<br>
    And he's taking over me<br>
    Is it too dark for you to see?<br>
    <br>
    You can come and see me in the dark<br>
    (If you use night vision)<br>
    Don't need no fire and no spark<br>
    (If you use night vision)<br>
    Give this love a kick start<br>
    (If you use night vision)<br>
    <br>
    (Night vision)<br>
    (Night vision)<br>
    (Night vision)<br>
    (Night vision)<br>
    <br>
    In the land of the blind<br>
    The night vision users are laughing at the king<br>
    But you'd be surprised what you can see<br>
    When you shine your evil light on me<br>
    <br>
    There we were<br>
    Just the two of us<br>
    Watching light fade into darkness<br>
    <br>
    I was dying<br>
    But then you saved me<br>
    Brought me back, just to say to me, woah<br>
    <br>
    There are asteroids in the sky brighter than you ever will<br>
    There are humanoids that love money so much that they would kill<br>
    <br>
    And it's taking over you<br>
    And it's taking over me<br>
    Is it too dark for you to see?<br>
    <br>
    You can come and see me in the dark<br>
    (If you use night vision)<br>
    Don't need no fire and no spark<br>
    (If you use night vision)<br>
    Give this love a kick start<br>
    (If you use night vision)<br>
    <br>
    (Night vision)<br>
    Come and see me in the dark<br>
    (Night vision)<br>
    Come and see me in the dark<br>
    (Night vision)<br>
    Come and see me in the dark<br>
    (Night vision)<br>
    <br>
    (Night vision)<br>
    (Night vision)<br>
    (Night vision)<br>
    (Night vision)<br>
    <br>
    (Night vision)<br>
    (Night vision)<br>
    (Night vision)<br>
    (Night vision)</p>
